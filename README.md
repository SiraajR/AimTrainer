# AimTrainer Personel Project.
#This project is written using JAVA GUI, in this random targets will appear and the user has to click on those targets in order to increase there personal score.
Currently, I am working to add different game modes to the aim trainer. The user can check their previous scores in a particular game mode by clicking on the scoreList
button when the user has at least completed one whole cycle of hitting targets.
